# Building Najibu: From Firebase to Full Self-Hosted Infrastructure

## Who I Am

Hi! I'm Alfred, a Software Engineer passionate about building scalable applications and mastering DevOps practices. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfred-wayne-kinyua/) where I share my journey in tech. I'm the solo developer behind **Najibu**, a comprehensive Bible trivia application that I built entirely from scratch.

## ü§î The Technology Decision: Why I Ditched Firebase

I thought about this for a while, and the obvious choice was to use Firebase as it supports auth, DB, storage, analytics... Pretty much everything I'd have wanted for a start. I have been wanting to perfect DevOps for a while, and even have a homeserver that I run many services like Jellyfin and AdGuard locally using containers.

I wanted to put all I had been learning into practice, and several factors made it much easier to go fully self-hosted:

### The Problems with Firebase

**1. Vendor Lock-in Concerns**
I wanted to host as much as I can, and use FOSS apps that I can also contribute to. I also have been burnt previously relying on hosted proprietary DBs - can Firestore count?

**2. Cost Projections Were Astronomical**
I ran comparisons for about 100k MAUs and the Firebase costs were astronomical, just for auth, let alone egress fees for the DB.

*Caption: Firebase vs self-hosted costs at different user scales*

**3. Learning & Control**
I wanted complete control over my infrastructure and the learning experience that comes with building everything from scratch.

**4. Performance Requirements**
Real-time multiplayer games need predictable latency and performance characteristics that are easier to achieve with dedicated infrastructure.

**5. Data Sovereignty**
Having complete control over where and how user data is stored and processed.

## üèóÔ∏è My Comprehensive Tech Stack

After extensive research and testing, I settled on a modern, scalable architecture that prioritizes performance, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness:

### 1. Caddy: Reverse Proxy

Caddy serves as my edge layer, handling:
- **Automatic HTTPS** with Let's Encrypt certificates
- **Reverse proxy** routing to different services
- **Load balancing** for high availability
- **Static file serving** for the landing page
- **Compression and caching** for optimal performance

```caddyfile
{
    admin off
    auto_https off
}

api.najibu.app {
    reverse_proxy oathkeeper:4455
}

auth.najibu.app {
    reverse_proxy kratos:4433
}

najibu.app {
    reverse_proxy najibu-landing:3000
}

grafana.najibu.app {
    reverse_proxy grafana:3000
}
```

Benefits of Caddy over alternatives:
- **Zero-configuration HTTPS**: Automatic certificate management
- **Simple configuration syntax**: Much easier than Nginx or Apache
- **Built-in load balancing**: No need for separate tools
- **Excellent documentation**: Quick setup and troubleshooting
- **Performance**: Written in Go, highly efficient
- **Plugin ecosystem**: Extensible for future needs

### 2. Ory Stack - Mostly because it uses Golang and I looove Go

I chose the Ory ecosystem for identity and access management because it provides enterprise-grade security with open-source flexibility.

#### Kratos: Identity Management

Handles user registration, login, password resets, and profile management:

```yaml
# kratos.yml
version: v0.11.1
dsn: postgres://kratos:password@postgres:5432/kratos
serve:
  public:
    base_url: https://auth.najibu.app
    cors:
      enabled: true
      allowed_origins:
        - https://najibu.app
        - https://api.najibu.app
selfservice:
  default_browser_return_url: https://najibu.app/
  flows:
    registration:
      ui_url: https://najibu.app/auth/registration
    login:
      ui_url: https://najibu.app/auth/login
    recovery:
      ui_url: https://najibu.app/auth/recovery
```

#### Oathkeeper: The Main Workhorse

Oathkeeper acts as the authentication and authorization proxy, sitting between Caddy and my API services:

```yaml
# oathkeeper-rules.yml
- id: "api-protected"
  match:
    url: "https://api.najibu.app/api/v1/<{user,games,leaderboards,achievements,friends}/**>"
    methods:
      - "GET"
      - "POST"
      - "PUT"
      - "DELETE"
      - "PATCH"
  authenticators:
    - handler: "session"
    - handler: "bearer_token"
  authorizer:
    handler: "allow"
  mutators:
    - handler: "noop"
    - handler: "id_token"
  upstream:
    preserve_host: true
    url: "http://najibu-go:8080"

- id: "api-public"
  upstream:
    preserve_host: true
    url: "http://najibu-go:8080"
  match:
    url: "https://api.najibu.app/api/v1/health"
    methods:
      - "GET"
      - "POST"
      - "PUT"
      - "DELETE"
      - "PATCH"
  authenticators:
    - handler: "anonymous"
  authorizer:
    handler: "allow"
  mutators:
    - handler: "noop"
```

### 3. Golang: Backend Language of Choice

The heart of Najibu is a Go-based API server using the Echo framework. Here's a glimpse of the real-time game management:

```go
func (h *GameHub) RunGame(ctx context.Context, gameID string) error {
    game := h.games[gameID]
    
    for questionIndex := 0; questionIndex < len(game.Questions); questionIndex++ {
        game.CurrentQuestionIndex = questionIndex
        
        // Broadcast question to all players
        questionMsg := QuestionMessage{
            QuestionIndex:   questionIndex,
            Question:       game.Questions[questionIndex].Text,
            Options:        game.Questions[questionIndex].Options,
            TimeLimit:      30, // seconds
            BibleReference: game.Questions[questionIndex].Reference,
        }
        
        h.broadcastToGame(gameID, "question", questionMsg)
        
        // Wait for answers or timeout
        select {
        case <-time.After(30 * time.Second):
            h.processQuestionResults(gameID, questionIndex)
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return ctx.Err()
        }
    }
    
    return h.endGame(gameID)
}

type GameMessage struct {
    Type string      `json:"type"`
    Data interface{} `json:"data"`
}

type QuestionMessage struct {
    QuestionIndex   int      `json:"question_index"`
    Question        string   `json:"question"`
    Options         []string `json:"options"`
    TimeLimit       int      `json:"time_limit"`
    BibleReference  string   `json:"bible_reference"`
}
```

### 4. Grafana: Comprehensive Monitoring

Real-time monitoring is crucial for multiplayer games. I've implemented custom metrics that track:

```go
var activeGamesGauge = prometheus.NewGauge(prometheus.GaugeOpts{
    Name: "najibu_active_games_total",
    Help: "Number of currently active games",
})

var gameCompletionCounter = prometheus.NewCounterVec(
    prometheus.CounterOpts{
        Name: "najibu_games_completed_total",
        Help: "Total number of completed games",
    },
    []string{"game_mode", "difficulty"},
)

var playerAnswerHistogram = prometheus.NewHistogramVec(
    prometheus.HistogramOpts{
        Name:    "najibu_player_answer_duration_seconds",
        Help:    "Time taken by players to answer questions",
        Buckets: prometheus.LinearBuckets(1, 2, 15), // 1s to 30s
    },
    []string{"difficulty", "correct"},
)
```

**Grafana Dashboards Include:**
- Real-time active players and games
- Question answer time distributions
- Game completion rates by difficulty
- User registration and authentication metrics
- System resource utilization
- API response times and error rates

### 5. PostgreSQL: Database Deep Dive

PostgreSQL serves as the backbone with carefully designed schemas for performance:

```sql
-- Users table with authentication integration
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    kratos_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Players table for game statistics
CREATE TABLE players (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    total_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    games_played INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    games_won INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    current_level INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    total_xp INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Optimized leaderboard query with window functions
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_players_total_score_desc 
ON players (total_score DESC) 
WHERE total_score > 0;

-- Games table for match history
CREATE TABLE games (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    game_mode VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    difficulty VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    max_players INTEGER NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'waiting',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 6. PostHog: Analytics & User Behavior

PostHog provides comprehensive analytics without the privacy concerns of Google Analytics:

```go
client, _ := posthog.NewWithConfig(os.Getenv("POSTHOG_API_KEY"), posthog.Config{
    Endpoint: "https://app.posthog.com",
})

func (s *GameService) trackGameEvent(userID, event string, properties map[string]interface{}) {
    client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
        DistinctId: userID,
        Event:      event,
        Properties: properties,
    })
}
```

## üéÆ Real-Time Multiplayer: The Technical Challenge

The most complex aspect of Najibu is the real-time multiplayer system. Here's how I architected it for scalability and fairness:

### WebSocket Message Protocol

I designed a JSON-based protocol for all game communications:

```go
type GameState struct {
    ID                   string                 `json:"id"`
    Players              []Player               `json:"players"`
    CurrentQuestionIndex int                    `json:"current_question_index"`
    Scores               map[string]int         `json:"scores"`
    Status               string                 `json:"status"`
    TimeRemaining        int                    `json:"time_remaining"`
}

type AnswerSubmission struct {
    PlayerID        string    `json:"player_id"`
    QuestionIndex   int       `json:"question_index"`
    SelectedOption  int       `json:"selected_option"`
    TimeTaken       float64   `json:"time_taken"`
    Timestamp       time.Time `json:"timestamp"`
}

func (g *Game) HandlePlayerAnswer(playerID string, answer AnswerSubmission) error {
    g.Mu.Lock()
    defer g.Mu.Unlock()
    
    // Validate answer timing and question index
    if answer.QuestionIndex != g.CurrentQuestionIndex {
        return errors.New("invalid question index")
    }
    
    // Store answer and calculate score
    g.QuestionAnswers[playerID] = answer
    
    if g.isAnswerCorrect(answer) {
        timeBonus := g.calculateTimeBonus(answer.TimeTaken)
        g.Scores[playerID] += 100 + timeBonus
    }
    
    return nil
}
```

### Concurrency & Thread Safety

Managing concurrent access is crucial for multiplayer games:

```go
type GameHub struct {
    games         map[string]*Game
    players       map[string]*Player
    mu            sync.RWMutex
    
    // Event channels for coordination
    gameEvents    chan GameEvent
    playerEvents  chan PlayerEvent
    shutdownChan  chan struct{}
}

type Game struct {
    ID                   string
    Players              map[string]*Player
    Scores               map[string]int
    CurrentQuestionIndex int
    QuestionAnswers      map[string]AnswerSubmission
    Mu                   sync.RWMutex
    Timer                *time.Timer
    MessageChan          chan GameMessage
    Done                 chan struct{}
}

func (h *GameHub) AddPlayerToGame(playerID, gameID string) error {
    h.mu.Lock()
    defer h.mu.Unlock()
    
    game, exists := h.games[gameID]
    if !exists {
        return errors.New("game not found")
    }
    
    if len(game.Players) >= game.MaxPlayers {
        return errors.New("game is full")
    }
    
    game.Players[playerID] = h.players[playerID]
    
    // Start game if we have enough players
    if len(game.Players) >= 2 {
        go h.RunGame(context.Background(), gameID)
    }
    
    return nil
}
```

## üèÜ Gamification & User Engagement

User retention is critical for any app. I implemented a comprehensive progression system:

### XP Calculation System

```go
func calculateXPEarnedWithBreakdown(baseScore int, timeTaken float64, difficulty string, streakBonus int) (int, map[string]int) {
    breakdown := make(map[string]int)
    
    // Base XP from score
    baseXP := baseScore / 10
    breakdown["base"] = baseXP
    
    // Time bonus (faster answers get more XP)
    timeBonus := 0
    if timeTaken < 10.0 {
        timeBonus = 15
    } else if timeTaken < 20.0 {
        timeBonus = 10
    } else if timeTaken < 30.0 {
        timeBonus = 5
    }
    breakdown["time_bonus"] = timeBonus
    
    // Difficulty multiplier
    difficultyMultiplier := 1.0
    switch difficulty {
    case "easy":
        difficultyMultiplier = 1.0
    case "medium":
        difficultyMultiplier = 1.5
    case "hard":
        difficultyMultiplier = 2.0
    }
    
    // Streak bonus
    breakdown["streak_bonus"] = streakBonus
    
    totalXP := int(float64(baseXP+timeBonus+streakBonus) * difficultyMultiplier)
    breakdown["total"] = totalXP
    
    return totalXP, breakdown
}
```

### Achievement System

I created a flexible achievement system that tracks various player accomplishments:

```sql
CREATE TABLE achievements (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    icon_url VARCHAR(255),
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    difficulty VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'medium',
    xp_reward INTEGER DEFAULT 100,
    requirements JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE user_achievements (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    achievement_id UUID REFERENCES achievements(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    unlocked_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    progress JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    UNIQUE(user_id, achievement_id)
);
```

## üê≥ DevOps & Infrastructure

The entire application runs on Docker Compose, making it incredibly portable and easy to deploy:

```yaml

### Production Deployment Considerations

**Security Hardening:**
- All services run as non-root users
- Secrets are managed through environment variables
- Database connections use SSL/TLS
- Rate limiting implemented at the Caddy level
- Regular security updates through automated Docker image pulls

**Backup Strategy:**
- Automated PostgreSQL backups every 6 hours
- Configuration files versioned in Git
- User uploads backed up to external storage
- Database replication for high availability

**Monitoring & Alerting:**
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana alerting rules for critical issues
- Log aggregation with structured logging
- Uptime monitoring through external services

## üìä Performance Optimizations & Results

### Database Optimizations

Connection pooling is critical for handling concurrent game sessions:

```go
func NewDBPool(databaseURL string) (*pgxpool.Pool, error) {
    config, err := pgxpool.ParseConfig(databaseURL)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    config.MaxConns = 50
    config.MinConns = 10
    config.MaxConnLifetime = time.Hour
    config.MaxConnIdleTime = time.Minute * 30
    config.HealthCheckPeriod = time.Minute
    
    return pgxpool.ConnectConfig(context.Background(), config)
}
```

### Performance Metrics

**Current Performance (Single VPS):**
- Supports 100+ concurrent WebSocket connections
- Sub-100ms API response times
- 99.9% uptime over 6 months
- Database queries optimized to under 10ms average
- Real-time game latency under 50ms

**Load Testing Results:**
- Handled 500 concurrent users during stress testing
- Memory usage remains stable under load
- CPU utilization peaks at 60% during high traffic
- Zero data loss during failover testing

**Scaling Bottlenecks Identified:**
- WebSocket connection limits (solvable with load balancing)
- Database connection pool (already optimized)
- Single point of failure (planning Kubernetes migration)

## üß™ Testing Strategy

Comprehensive testing ensures reliability in production:

```go
func TestGameCreation(t *testing.T) {
    hub := NewGameHub()
    
    gameID, err := hub.CreateGame("multiplayer", "medium", 4)
    assert.NoError(t, err)
    assert.NotEmpty(t, gameID)
    
    game := hub.GetGame(gameID)
    assert.Equal(t, "waiting", game.Status)
    assert.Equal(t, 4, game.MaxPlayers)
    assert.Equal(t, 0, len(game.Players))
}

func TestWebSocketGameFlow(t *testing.T) {
    server := httptest.NewServer(setupTestServer())
    defer server.Close()
    
    // Convert HTTP URL to WebSocket URL
    wsURL := "ws" + strings.TrimPrefix(server.URL, "http") + "/ws"
    
    // Connect multiple players
    var connections []*websocket.Conn
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        conn, _, err := websocket.DefaultDialer.Dial(wsURL, nil)
        assert.NoError(t, err)
        connections = append(connections, conn)
        defer conn.Close()
        
        // Join game
        joinMsg := map[string]interface{}{
            "type": "join_game",
            "data": map[string]interface{}{
                "player_id": fmt.Sprintf("player_%d", i),
            },
        }
        err = conn.WriteJSON(joinMsg)
        assert.NoError(t, err)
    }
    
    // Verify game starts automatically
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    
    // Check that all players receive game_started message
    for _, conn := range connections {
        var response map[string]interface{}
        err := conn.ReadJSON(&response)
        assert.NoError(t, err)
        assert.Equal(t, "game_started", response["type"])
    }
}

func TestConcurrentGameSessions(t *testing.T) {
    hub := NewGameHub()
    
    // Create multiple games concurrently
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    gameIDs := make([]string, 0, 100)
    mutex := sync.Mutex{}
    
    for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            
            gameID, err := hub.CreateGame("quick", "easy", 2)
            assert.NoError(t, err)
            
            mutex.Lock()
            gameIDs = append(gameIDs, gameID)
            mutex.Unlock()
        }()
    }
    
    wg.Wait()
    
    // Verify all games were created successfully
    assert.Equal(t, 100, len(gameIDs))
    
    // Verify no duplicate game IDs
    gameIDSet := make(map[string]bool)
    for _, id := range gameIDs {
        assert.False(t, gameIDSet[id], "Duplicate game ID found")
        gameIDSet[id] = true
    }
}
```

## üì± Mobile App Integration

The Flutter app seamlessly integrates with the backend through WebSocket connections and RESTful APIs:

### WebSocket State Management

```dart
class GameStateProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  IOWebSocketChannel? _channel;
  GameState? _currentGame;
  
  void connectToGame(String gameId, String playerId) {
    _channel = IOWebSocketChannel.connect(
      'wss://api.najibu.app/ws',
      headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer $token'},
    );
    
    _channel!.stream.listen((data) {
      final message = jsonDecode(data);
      _handleGameMessage(message);
    });
    
    // Join the game
    _channel!.sink.add(jsonEncode({
      'type': 'join_game',
      'data': {'game_id': gameId, 'player_id': playerId}
    }));
  }
  
  void submitAnswer(int questionIndex, int selectedOption) {
    _channel!.sink.add(jsonEncode({
      'type': 'submit_answer',
      'data': {
        'question_index': questionIndex,
        'selected_option': selectedOption,
        'timestamp': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),
      }
    }));
  }
  
  void _handleGameMessage(Map<String, dynamic> message) {
    switch (message['type']) {
      case 'question':
        _currentGame = _currentGame?.copyWith(
          currentQuestion: Question.fromJson(message['data']),
        );
        break;
      case 'game_state':
        _currentGame = GameState.fromJson(message['data']);
        break;
      case 'game_ended':
        _handleGameEnd(message['data']);
        break;
    }
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

### Authentication Flow

```dart
class AuthService {
  final Dio _dio = Dio();
  
  Future<AuthResult> login(String email, String password) async {
    try {
      // Initialize login flow with Kratos
      final flowResponse = await _dio.get(
        'https://auth.najibu.app/self-service/login/api',
      );
      
      final flowId = flowResponse.data['id'];
      
      // Submit credentials
      final loginResponse = await _dio.post(
        'https://auth.najibu.app/self-service/login',
        data: {
          'flow': flowId,
          'method': 'password',
          'password_identifier': email,
          'password': password,
        },
      );
      
      final sessionToken = loginResponse.data['session_token'];
      await _storeToken(sessionToken);
      
      return AuthResult.success(sessionToken);
    } catch (e) {
      return AuthResult.failure(e.toString());
    }
  }
  
  Future<void> _storeToken(String token) async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.setString('session_token', token);
  }
}
```

## üìà Analytics & Business Intelligence

### PostHog Integration

I track key user behaviors and game metrics:

```go
func (s *GameService) trackGameEvent(userID, event string, properties map[string]interface{}) {
    s.posthog.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
        DistinctId: userID,
        Event:      event,
        Properties: properties,
        Timestamp:  time.Now(),
    })
}

func (s *GameService) CompleteGame(gameID string, results GameResults) error {
    // Save to database
    err := s.saveGameResults(gameID, results)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    
    // Track analytics for each player
    for playerID, score := range results.Scores {
        s.trackGameEvent(playerID, "game_completed", map[string]interface{}{
            "game_id":     gameID,
            "score":       score,
            "duration":    results.Duration.Seconds(),
            "difficulty":  results.Difficulty,

## üí° Lessons Learned & Insights

### What Went Exceptionally Well

**Self-Hosting Decision:**
The move away from Firebase proved to be the right choice. Not only did it save significant costs, but it also gave me complete control over the infrastructure and valuable DevOps experience.

**Go for Backend Development:**
Go's concurrency model with goroutines and channels made handling real-time multiplayer games much simpler than it would have been in other languages. The performance and memory efficiency have been outstanding.

**Docker Compose for Development:**
Having the entire stack runnable with a single `docker-compose up` command made development iterations incredibly fast and eliminated environment-related issues.

**Monitoring from Day One:**
Setting up Grafana and Prometheus early in the development process helped identify performance bottlenecks before they became critical issues.

### Challenges Overcome

**WebSocket Connection Management:**
Managing thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections required careful consideration of connection pooling, heartbeat mechanisms, and graceful degradation under load.

**Database Performance:**
Initially, leaderboard queries were slow. Adding proper indexes and using PostgreSQL window functions dramatically improved performance from seconds to milliseconds.

**Authentication Integration:**
Integrating Ory Kratos with both the mobile app and web frontend required understanding OAuth flows and session management deeply.

**Real-Time Synchronization:**
Ensuring all players see questions at exactly the same time required implementing clock synchronization and compensation for network latency.

### What I'd Do Differently

**Earlier Load Testing:**
I should have implemented comprehensive load testing earlier in the development process to identify scaling bottlenecks sooner.

**Microservices from the Start:**
While the monolithic approach was faster initially, I'm now refactoring into microservices. Starting with that architecture would have saved time.

**More Comprehensive Logging:**
Implementing structured logging and distributed tracing from the beginning would have made debugging much easier.

**Mobile-First API Design:**
Some API endpoints were designed desktop-first and required modification for optimal mobile performance.
