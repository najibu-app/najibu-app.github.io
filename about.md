# About Me

Hey! I'm Alfred Wayne Kinyua, a software engineer based in Kenya with over 8 years of production coding experience. I've spent most of my career building scalable systems and solving complex problems in the trenches, and I'm just starting to document and share what I've learned along the way.

## My Journey

C++ was my entry point into programming though I quicly shifted to Python and React, and over the past 8+ years, I've been deep in production environments - debugging midnight incidents, optimizing database queries, and architecting systems that handle real user traffic. I recently decided to start writing about my experiences, beginning with my latest project: Najibu, a self-hosted Bible quiz app with real-time multiplayer functionality.

## What I Do

With 8+ years in production environments, I've worked across the full stack - from Go backends and PostgreSQL databases to Flutter mobile apps. My recent focus has been on self-hosted infrastructure: building with Caddy, Ory stack for auth, Grafana for monitoring, and container orchestration. I believe in owning your tech stack and understanding every layer of your system.

## Skills & Interests

- **Backend**: Go, Python, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Mobile**: Flutter, Dart
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Caddy, Ory stack (Kratos/Oathkeeper)
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus, PostHog
- **8+ years**: Production systems, database optimization, real-time applications

## This Blog

After 8+ years of coding in production, I'm finally starting to write about what I've learned. This is my attempt at documenting the real challenges of building software - the late-night debugging sessions, the architecture decisions, and the lessons learned from systems running in the wild. Starting with my Najibu project and expanding from there.

Thanks for stopping by! This is my first attempt at technical writing, so bear with me as I figure out how to translate 8+ years of production experience into readable content. ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª
